# Hello!

I have been toying from time to time with the idea of ordering all the
information that I keep accumulating - I have a mild electronic
diogenes syndrome -, and frankly most of it should either be thrown
away, or at least archived in the public view. Perhaps that way
something will be of value to someone else.

For example, I often imagine things that I will probably never build -
it might be interesting to have that here.

Also, I'm struggling to build some things on my spare time, and that
takes me into investigations that could end up here, instead of in a
random notepad file in my hard drive.

So I have created this page to post things and forget about them.
Probably most of it will be useless, but if Google makes you find
something of value, please let me know!

Cheers.
