# Notes on Programming

This is the public repository for the blog that I maintain in Github Pages; it's best if you visit it directly [here](http://alexati.github.io).

If you're curious about how it's done, have a look at [Markdwon](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), as well as at the [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) information. It is quite easy to set up.
