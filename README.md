# Notes on Programming

This is the public repository for the (very lightweight) blog that I maintain in Github Pages; it's best if you visit it directly [here](http://alexati.github.io).

It's main intent is to document different things that I found useful in the past, with some more context that just a github gist.

If you're curious about how it's done, have a look at [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), as well as at the [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) information. It is quite easy to set up.
